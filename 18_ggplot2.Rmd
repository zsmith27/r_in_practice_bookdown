)

library(tidyr)
```

### Example Data

Import the example data. This data represents benthic macroinvertebrate data collected in the littoral zone of Onondaga, Otisco, and Cazenovia lakes.
```{r}
taxa.df <- file.path("data",
          "zms_thesis-macro_2017-06-18.csv") %>% 
  read.csv(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Preprocess `taxa.df` to just represent order-level taxonomic counts per sample. For more details about this process see the [summarize] section.
```{r}
ord.df <- taxa.df %>% 
  select(unique_id, station_id, lake, order, count) %>% 
  group_by(unique_id, station_id, lake, order) %>% 
  summarize(count = sum(count)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(station_id, lake, order) %>% 
  summarize(count = mean(count)) %>% 
  ungroup()

DT::datatable(ord.df, options = list(columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-center', targets = 0:3))))
```

Calculate the calculate relative abundance (i.e., the percentage of the sample represented by each taxon) of each taxon within a sample. For more details about this process see the [group_by] section.
```{r}
pct.df <- ord.df %>% 
  group_by(station_id) %>% 
  mutate(total = sum(count),
         percent = count / total * 100) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  tidyr::complete(order,
                  nesting(station_id, lake, total),
                  fill = list(count = 0, percent = 0)) %>% 
  mutate(lake = factor(lake, levels = c("onon", "ot", "caz")))
```

### ggplot

* __Definition:__ "initializes a ggplot object." (quote from link below)
* __Link:__ https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html

Generally, you want to start with a `ggplot()` call. Here we can see a blank figure template returned when `ggplot()` is called and `pct.df` is specified as data. The pipe operator can be used to pipe data into `ggplot()` but it cannot be used to chain subsequent __ggplot2__ functions together.
```{r}
ggplot(pct.df)

pct.df %>% 
  ggplot()
```

### aes

* __Definition:__ specify aesthetics (x-axis, y-axis, color, fill, shape, size, linetype, etc.)
* __Link:__ https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes.html

To start to format the figure, you will want to use `aes()`. When using `aes()` within `ggplot()`, you are specifying global variables. For instance, you will generally specify the columns, from the specified data frame (e.g., `pct.df`), that will represent your x-axis and y-axis. In the example below, the `lake` column represents the x-axis, while the `percent` column will represents the y-axis. Now we have a template for our figure but we will want to add layers (boxplot, scatter plot, bar plot) to this feature to visualize our data. 
```{r}
pct.df %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = lake, y = percent))
```
### Adding Layers (`+`)

__ggplot2__ does not recognize the pipe operator (`%>%`), instead it uses `+` to add components to a plot. 

Now let's add data to the plot by adding a `+` at the end of `ggplot()` and then specifying the plot type we are interested in creating. All plot functions in __ggplot2__ start with the prefix "geom_".

### geom_boxplot

* __Definition:__ create box and whisker plots
* __Link:__ https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_boxplot.html

Here we will create a box and whisker plot using `geom_boxplot()`. For this example, we will only focus on the percentage of Ephemeroptera (Mayflies) found within each lake by using the `filter()` function before the `ggplot()` function. The aesthetics have been specified within `ggplot()`, therefore `geom_boxplot()` can be called without any arguments.
```{r}
pct.df %>%
  filter(order == "ephemeroptera") %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = lake, y = percent)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

#### Fill

The color of the interquartile boxes can be specified with `fill`. In this example, `fill = lake`, which __ggplot2__ will automatically realize represents three categories and use a default color palette that is used to automatically color the plot.
`fill` is specified within `aes()` within the `ggplot()` , and therefore this specification carries through to the subsequent `geom_boxplot()` call.
```{r}
pct.df %>%
  filter(order == "ephemeroptera") %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = lake, y = percent, fill = lake)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

#### Color

Color can be sepecified in a similar manner to [Fill]. In the plot below, we can see the difference between color and fill (the previous plot).
```{r}
pct.df %>%
  filter(order == "ephemeroptera") %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = lake, y = percent, color = lake)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

When I first started using __ggplot2__, I would frequently try to put the color or other aesthetic arguments outside of the `aes()` call. For example, in `ggplot(aes(x = lake, y = percent), color = lake)`, `color = lake` is not within the `aes()` call. Therefore, it has no effect on the plot (i.e., there is no color added to the plot).
```{r}
pct.df %>%
  filter(order == "ephemeroptera") %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = lake, y = percent), color = lake) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

`aes()` and the color or other aesthetics can also be specified within the `geom_boxplot()` call. This allows you to be more specific of which feature you want to recieve a given aesthetic. 
```{r}
pct.df %>%
  filter(order == "ephemeroptera") %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = lake, y = percent)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = lake))
```

Additionally, if you want to specify specific colors not based on features from your data frame (e.g., `lake`), then you can specify these colors within the `geom_boxplot()` call. Note, that `color` is __NOT__ specified within an `aes()` call.
```{r}
pct.df %>%
  filter(order == "ephemeroptera") %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = lake, y = percent)) +
  geom_boxplot(color = c("purple", "orange", "brown"))
```

If you do attempt to wrap manually specified colors, like `color = c("purple", "orange", "brown")`, within `aes()`, you will get an error.
```{r, error=TRUE}
pct.df %>%
  filter(order == "ephemeroptera") %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = lake, y = percent)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = c("purple", "orange", "brown")))
```

Also, trying to manually specify colors within the `ggplot()` call will have no effect on the plot.
```{r}
pct.df %>%
  filter(order == "ephemeroptera") %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = lake, y = percent), color = c("purple", "orange", "brown")) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

#### geom_point

* __Definition:__ add points to a plot
* __Link:__ https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html

Let's add another layer to the plot above. `geom_point()` can be used to vizualize where the data points actually fall relative to the box and whisker plots.
```{r}
pct.df %>%
  filter(order == "ephemeroptera") %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = lake, y = percent)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point()
```

#### geom_jitter

* __Definition:__ add points to a plot that have been randomly offplaced from their actual position to avoid point overlap
* __Link:__ https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_jitter.html

In the [geom_point] plot above, it is not possible to know if a point represents a single sample or if there are more than one samples with the same value overlaid on one another. `geom_jitter()` can be used to randomly offset the points from thier actual position to avoid the overlap issue present in `geom_point()`.

In this example, `geom_jitter()` is used to offest the points overlaid on the box and whisker plots. The points are colored by `lake` within this call: `geom_jitter(aes(color = lake))`. Additionally, the outliers plotted from `geom_boxplot()` are hidden with `geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA)`. These outliers are represented in the `geom_jitter()` call; therefore, if the outliers were not removed from `geom_boxplot()`, these points would be represented twice.
```{r}
pct.df %>%
  filter(order == "ephemeroptera") %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = lake, y = percent)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = lake))
```

Here we can see what happens if `color` is specified within the `ggplot()` call. Now the box and whisker lines and the points are colored by lake. This is in contrast to the last plot, where only the points were colored by lake.
```{r}
pct.df %>%
  filter(order == "ephemeroptera") %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = lake, y = percent, color = lake)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter()
```

#### geom_violin

* __Definition:__ create violin plots a way of visualizing point density and distribution
* __Link:__ https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_violin.html

This plot helps us to see that there are a lot of samples from Onondaga Lake ("onon") that have no Ephemeroptera (percent = 0).
```{r}
pct.df %>%
  filter(order == "ephemeroptera") %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = lake, y = percent, fill = lake)) +
  geom_violin()
```

#### geom_dotplot

* __Definition:__ create dot plots or beeswarm plots a way of visualizing point density and distribution
* __Link:__ https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_dotplot.html

Similar to [violin_plots], `geom_dotplot()` can be more informative than a box and whisker plot.
```{r, fig.width=8}
pct.df %>%
  filter(order == "ephemeroptera") %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = lake, y = percent, fill = lake)) +
  geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y",
               stackdir = "center",
               binwidth = 0.25)
```

`geom_dotplot()` could be overlaid on `geom_boxplot()`, which may be a better than a [geom_jitter] example.
```{r, fig.width=8}
pct.df %>%
  filter(order == "ephemeroptera") %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = lake, y = percent)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_dotplot(aes(fill = lake),
               binaxis = "y",
               stackdir = "center",
               binwidth = 0.25)
```

#### geom_bar

* __Definition:__ create bar plots
* __Link:__ https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html

For this section, the data will need to be summarized by lake. The data is aggregated by `lake` and `order`, and the median abundance (`count`) is calculated. The top five taxa observed are retained as normal but the remaining taxa are lumped and reclassified as "Other" (`forcats::fct_lump(factor(order), n = 5, w = percent)`). The taxa are then sorted in descending order based on the taxa most commonly observed (`forcats::fct_reorder(order, percent, median, .desc = TRUE)`).
```{r}
abund.df <- pct.df %>% 
  group_by(lake, order) %>% 
  summarise(count = median(count)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(order = forcats::fct_lump(factor(order),
                                   n = 5,
                                   w = count),
         order = forcats::fct_reorder(order, count, median, .desc = TRUE),
         lake = factor(lake, c("onon", "ot", "caz")))

DT::datatable(abund.df, options = list(scrollX = TRUE))
```

Using `geom_bar()`, we can generate a bar plot. `state = "identity"` must be used when a `y` value is specified in `aes()`; otherwise, __ggplot2__ will simiply count the number of `x` value instances to create a y-axis count. 

__WARNING:__ This plot is a quick example of `geom_bar()` and is not a good representation of the data. In this case, the median abundance was calculated for each taxon within each lake. `geom_bar()` is summing the median values per taxon per lake to produce this figure.
```{r}
abund.df %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = order, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

As the warning above notes, the above plot is not a great representation of the data because it essentially sums the three median abundance values per taxon per lake to produce the bars. We can see this breakdown by adding `fill = TRUE`. This is also a poor way of view this data.
```{r}
abund.df %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = order, y = count, fill = lake)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

`position = "dodge"` can be added to the `geom_bar()` call to make the bars for each lake appear side-by-side.
```{r, fig.width=8}
abund.df %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = order, y = count, fill = lake)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",
           position = "dodge")
```

##### Stacked Bar Plots

Another great way to visualize this data is to create stacked bar plots. Stacked bar plots are almost always the better alternative to pie charts. In general, stack bar charts provide a more straight forward representation of quantity, which makes it easier to compare multiple stacked bar charts, then multiple pie charts.

* Note that in this section the x-axis now represents `lake`, the y-axis represents `count`, and the fill represents `order`.

Stacked bar plots can be created by adding `position = "stack"` to the `geom_bar()` call. This information is exactly the same as the `geom_bar()` plot above, where `position = "dodge"` but it is more condensed.
```{r, fig.width=8}
abund.df %>% 
  mutate(order = forcats::fct_reorder(order, count, median)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = lake, y = count, fill = order)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",
           position = "stack")
```

Stacked bar plots can also be created by adding `position = "fill"` to the `geom_bar()` call. This effectively calculates relative abundance, the percentage each taxon represents within a lake. This normalizes the data and makes it easier to compare between lakes.
```{r, fig.width=8}
abund.df %>% 
  mutate(order = forcats::fct_reorder(order, count, median)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = lake, y = count, fill = order)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",
           position = "fill")
```

#### geom_point (Scatter Plot)

* __Definition:__ add points to a plot
* __Link:__ https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html

Creating a scatter plot is probably a more common use for `geom_point()` then the use from the [geom_point] section above.

The `pct.df` data frame is converted from a long to a wide data format using spread. This data will be used throughout this section.
```{r}
wide.df <- pct.df %>% 
  select(station_id, lake, percent, order) %>% 
  spread(order, percent)
```

Diptera and Amphipoda were the two must frequently identified taxonomic orders in this data set. Let's see if there is a relationship between these organisms by plotting counts of Diptera on the x-axis and counts of Amphipoda on the y-axis. `geom_point()` is used to create a scattter plot. There appears to be an inverse relationship between the number of amphipods observed and the number of diptera observed.
```{r, fig.width=8}
wide.df %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = diptera, y = amphipoda)) +
  geom_point()
```

We can color the points by `lake` to see if this pattern is consistent accross lakes.
```{r, fig.width=8}
wide.df %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = diptera, y = amphipoda)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = lake))
```

#### geom_line

* __Definition:__ draw a line between points
* __Link:__ https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_path.html

A common mistake I make is to use `geom_line()` instead of `geom_smooth()`. `geom_line()` will connect points direcetly but I ussually want a linear model. 
```{r, fig.width=8}
wide.df %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = diptera, y = amphipoda)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = lake)) +
  geom_line()
```

#### geom_smooth

* __Definition:__ plot a linear model (e.g., linear model, LOESS)
* __Link:__ https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html

`geom_smooth()` allows you to specify a `method`, such as "lm" (linear model) or "loess" (LOESS) and a formula (such as `y ~ x`). In the figure below, a linear model is created using all of the data. The blue line represents the linear model and the gray band represents the standard error around the model.
```{r, fig.width=8}
wide.df %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = diptera, y = amphipoda)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = lake)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
```

Maybe we want to create a linear model per lake. This can be done by specifying `color = lake` within the `ggplot()` `aes()` call. Now we can see that all lakes have a similar slope but Otisco Lake has less variability in Amphipoda and Diptera counts.
```{r, fig.width=8}
wide.df %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = diptera, y = amphipoda, color = lake)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
```

The standard error bands in the figure above make it difficult to read the plot. These bands can be removed by specifying `se = FALSE` in the `geom_smooth()` call.
```{r, fig.width=8}
wide.df %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = diptera, y = amphipoda, color = lake)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE)
```

We may also be interested in creating a LOESS curve for all of the data. This can be done by specifying `method = "loess"` within `geom_smooth()`.
```{r, fig.width=8}
wide.df %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = diptera, y = amphipoda)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = lake)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = y ~ x)
```

Again, `color` and `fill` can be specified in the `ggplot()` `aes()` call to apply these features globably. The plot below shows a LOESS curve for each lake. `color` influenced the point and line color in the plot, while fill influenced the color of the standard error bands.
```{r, fig.width=8}
wide.df %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = diptera, y = amphipoda, color = lake, fill = lake)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = lake)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = y ~ x)
```

#### facet_wrap

* __Definition:__ replicate a plot by a specified feature or features
* __Link:__ https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_wrap.html

`facet_wrap()` is one of my favorite functions. It allows you to create multiple plots at once base on a specified feature or features. 

For this example the data are modified in a manner that will allow us to compare the counts of each order to Diptera counts. The `~order` within `facet_wrap()` specifies that we want to aggregate and loop through each unique string in the `order` column.
```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=10}
pct.df %>% 
  select(station_id, lake, percent, order) %>% 
  spread(order, percent) %>% 
  gather(order, count, amphipoda:veneroida, -diptera) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = diptera, y = count, color = lake, fill = lake)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = lake)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~order)
```

The defaults for the `facet_wrap()` arguements above make it a little hard to read all of the plots becuase they do not have the range of the Diptera vs. Amphipoda. the `scales` arguement can be used to "free" all of the axis (`scales = "free"`). This scales each of the x- and y-axes ranges specific to each plot, rather than standardizing across all plots.

* scales
    + "free_x" = y-axis standardized across plots but x-axis is specific to each plot
    + "free_y" = x-axis standardized across plots but y-asix is specific to each plot
    + "free" = both x- and y-axes are specific to each plot
```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=10}
pct.df %>% 
  select(station_id, lake, percent, order) %>% 
  spread(order, percent) %>% 
  gather(order, count, amphipoda:veneroida, -diptera) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = diptera, y = count, color = lake, fill = lake)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = lake)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~order,
             scales = "free")
```

Additionally, `ncol` (number of columns) can be used to modify the organization of figures.
```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=20}
pct.df %>% 
  select(station_id, lake, percent, order) %>% 
  spread(order, percent) %>% 
  gather(order, count, amphipoda:veneroida, -diptera) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = diptera, y = count, color = lake, fill = lake)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = lake)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~order,
             scales = "free",
             ncol = 1)
```

We can use more than one feature to `facet_wrap()` by. For example, in the call below the plots are aggregated by `order` and `lake` (`~order + lake`). 
```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=20}
pct.df %>% 
  select(station_id, lake, percent, order) %>% 
  spread(order, percent) %>% 
  gather(order, count, amphipoda:veneroida, -diptera) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = diptera, y = count, color = lake, fill = lake)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = lake)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~order + lake,
             ncol = 3)
```

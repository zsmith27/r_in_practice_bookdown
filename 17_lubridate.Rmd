```{r}
library(lubridate)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(
 library(dplyr) 
)
```

### Example Data

Import the example data. This data represents benthic macroinvertebrate data collected in the littoral zone of Onondaga, Otisco, and Cazenovia lakes.
```{r}
taxa.df <- file.path("data",
          "zms_thesis-macro_2017-06-18.csv") %>% 
  read.csv(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Preprocess `taxa.df` to only include unique instances of station IDs and sample dates. For more details about this process see the [select] and [distinct] sections.
```{r}
dates.df <- taxa.df %>% 
  select(station_id, date) %>% 
  distinct()

DT::datatable(dates.df, options = list(columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-center', targets = 0:2))))
```

### mdy, ymd, dmy, ymd_hms, ...

* __Definition:__ convert character or numeric data class to a date or datetime class. There are a lot of variations of this function that are specific to the format of your date or datetime.
* __Link:__ https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/lubridate/versions/1.7.4/topics/ymd

In `dates.df`, the `date` column is imported as a character class and follows a "mm/dd/yyyy" format. The function `mdy()` can be used convert the character strings in the `date` column to a date class.
```{r}
mdy.df <- dates.df %>% 
  mutate(date = mdy(date))

DT::datatable(mdy.df, options = list(columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-center', targets = 0:2))))
```

In the example above, it is obvious the the format of the date has changed but it is not obvious that the R-class has changed. First look at the classes represented in the `dates.df`.
```{r}
sapply(dates.df, class)
```

Then looking at the column classes in `myd.df`, we can see `date` has changed to class "Date".
```{r}
sapply(mdy.df, class)
```


### year, month, mday, yday, hour, minute, and second

* __Definition:__ these functions allow you to extract a specific feature of a date or datetime class. The returned values will no longer be a date or datetime class.
* __Links:__ 
    + year: https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/year.html
    + month:https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/month.html 
    + week: https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/week.html
    + day: https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/day.html
        + wday
        + mday
        + qday
        + yday
    + hour: https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/hour.html
    + minute: https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/minute.html
    + second: https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/second.html

Once a column is a date or datetime class, then lubridate functions make it easy to extract parts of the date, such as year, month, day, hour, minutes, seconds, etc. In the `mutate()` call below, I applied many but not all of the helpful functions for extracting datetime related information. The majority of these are straight forward; however, we can change `label` and `abbr` to alter the output of functions like `month()` and `wday()`.

1. `label`
    + `label = FALSE` returns a numeric value
    + `label = TRUE` returns a character value
2. `abbr`
    + If `label = FALSE`, then `abbr` has no effect
    + `label = TRUE` and `abbr = TRUE` returns an abbreviated character string
        + week: Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat
        + month: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
    + `label = TRUE` and `abbr = FALSE` returns an full character string
        + week: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
        + month: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December
        
```{r}
extract.df <- mdy.df %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date),
         month_int = month(date),
         month_abv = month(date, label = TRUE),
         month_full = month(date, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE),
         week = week(date),
         day = day(date),
         wday_int = wday(date),
         wday_abv = wday(date, label = TRUE),
         wday_full = wday(date, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE),
         mday = mday(date),
         qday = qday(date),
         yday = yday(date),
         hour = hour(date),
         minute = minute(date),
         second = second(date))

DT::datatable(extract.df, options = list(scrollX = TRUE))
```

### round_date, floor_date, and ceiling_date

* __Definition:__ round a date or datetime value by a specified unit of time.
* __Links:__ https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/round_date.html

`round_date()` will round the date or datetime by the specified unit of time, such as "15 minutes", "week", "month", or "year". I find it really convient that you can specify to the nearest "15 minutes". `floor_date()` and `ceiling_date()` provide similar functionality but always round down or up, respectively.
```{r}
round.df <- mdy.df %>% 
  mutate(round_week = round_date(date, "week"),
         round_month = round_date(date, "month"),
         round_year = round_date(date, "year"),
         round_year5 = round_date(date, "5 years"),
         round_century = round_date(date, "100 years"),
         floor_month = floor_date(date, "month"),
         floor_year = floor_date(date, "year"),
         ceiling_month = ceiling_date(date, "month"),
         ceiling_year = ceiling_date(date, "year"))

DT::datatable(round.df, options = list(scrollX = TRUE,
                                       autoWidth = TRUE,
                                       columnDefs = list(list(width = '70px', targets = c(2)))))
```

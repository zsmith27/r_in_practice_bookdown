# Pipe Operator Exercise solutions

```{r}
library(magrittr)
```

Import the example data. This data represents benthic macroinvertebrate data collected in the littoral zone of Onondaga, Otisco, and Cazenovia lakes.
```{r}
taxa.df <- file.path("data",
          "zms_thesis-macro_2017-06-18.csv") %>% 
  read.csv(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

1. Extract the `final_id` column from `taxa.df` and pipe it into the function `toupper()`.
    + Store it as an object called "upper.vec"

2. Extract just unique strings from the `final_id` column of `taxa.df` by piping into the `unique()` function.

3. Combine exercises 1 and 2 to return unique strings from the `final_id` column  of `taxa.df` represented as all caps.

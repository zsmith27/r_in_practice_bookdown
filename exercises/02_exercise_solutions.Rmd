# Data Type Exercise Solutions

1. Create a character vector with 4 elements.
```{r}
c("w", "x", "y", "z")
```

2. Verify that the vector created is character type.
```{r}
class(c("w", "x", "y", "z"))
class(c("w", "x", "y", "z")) == "character"
```
3. Sort the character vector.
```{r}
sort(c("w", "x", "y", "z"))
```

4. Convert the character vector to a factor vector and specify levels that are __NOT__ in alphabetical order and sort this factor vector.
```{r}
sort(factor(c("w", "x", "y", "z"), levels = c("x", "z", "w", "y")))
```
